# Crowdfunding Fraud Detection

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to classify crowdfunding campaigns as potentially fraudulent or legitimate. By analyzing project descriptions, funding patterns, and metadata, the system helps identify suspicious campaigns before they can cause financial harm to backers.

## Problem Statement
Crowdfunding platforms face significant challenges with fraudulent campaigns that can mislead backers and damage platform credibility. This project addresses this issue through a data-driven approach that combines:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) of project descriptions and titles
- Analysis of funding patterns and backer behavior
- Examination of creator history and campaign metadata

## Dataset
The project utilizes the Kickstarter Projects Dataset, which includes:
- **Text Data**: Project titles, descriptions, and updates
- **Numerical Features**: 
  - Funding goals and amounts raised
  - Number of backers
  - Campaign duration
- **Categorical Data**:
  - Project categories
  - Creator history and previous campaigns
  - Campaign outcomes

## Approach
The model combines:
1. NLP techniques to analyze text content for suspicious patterns
2. Feature engineering to create meaningful predictors from raw data
3. Binary classification to flag potentially fraudulent campaigns

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing pipeline for cleaning and preparing crowdfunding campaign data
- Feature engineering to extract meaningful patterns
- Machine learning models trained to detect potential fraud
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance
- Visualization tools for result interpretation

## Potential Impact
- **For Backers**: Make more informed decisions when supporting campaigns
- **For Platforms**: Improve trust and safety by flagging suspicious campaigns
- **For Campaign Creators**: Maintain a fair and transparent crowdfunding environment

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebooks for analysis
